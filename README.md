# Installing
## General Install
### 1. Clone this repository
You can do this using the git CLI (if you have it installed) or just download the zip file on the Code page.
### 2. Install Python and the required dependencies
Download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Latest version is recommended, but anything higher than Python 3.7 should work)

Make sure to choose "Add Python to PATH" when installing to make this tutorial easy to follow!

Now, open your command prompt and use those commands to install the required modules:
```commandline
pip install telethon
```

```commandline
pip install rich
```

### 3. Create a Telegram Application
To work, livebio-tg requires a Telegram app to change your bio.

To create a Telegram application, go to this [page](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and log into your Telegram account.

After you login, you will need to fill out a form, you can fill it in with anything you want, but make sure that all fields are filled.

If there is no error while creating an app, you will see a screen with your app info.

You need to copy the "api_id" and the "api_hash" and write them down somewhere (you shouldn't share those values with anyone)

### 4. Configuring livebio
After you cloned the repository, head to the config.py file.

It is a Python dictionary (has JSON-like syntax)

#### Config Structure
Presented in a more readable format.
```yaml
telegram:
  app:
    id: int("Your api_id here")
    hash: str("Your api_hash here")
  auth:
    mode: mode_enum("Authentication mode here - can be string or file")
    string: str("Your session string here - set it if you are using string mode") (Default is "file")
    
script:
  splitter: str("A string that splits output of plugins") (Default is "|")
  template: str("The template used to generate your bio")
  delay: int(The delay between each bio change) (Default is 20)
  max_length: int(The max length of the bio) (Default is 70, set it to 140 if you have Telegram Premium)
 
 plugins:
  plugin_name:
    plugin: config
    is: here
```
Each plugin will have a reference on how you need to configure it.

[What authentication mode should I choose, and why?](AUTH.md)

[How do I make a template?](TEMPLATE.md)

Example Config (has some plugin configs):
```python
{
  "telegram": {
    "app": {
      "id": int(4664),
      "hash": str("asdf")
    },
    "auth": {
      "mode": mode_enum("string"),
      "string": str("12i3j1ijsewetweT")
    }
  },
  "script": {
    "splitter": "|",
    "template": str("{%plugin:timeUNSPLIT%} {%plugin:discord%} i use livebio btw ðŸ˜Ž"),
    # Produces an output like this: "01:23 Playing Minecraft | i use livebio btw ðŸ˜Ž"
    "delay": int(20),
    "max_length": int(70)
  },
  "plugins": {
    "time": {
