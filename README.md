# livebio-tg
## Bridge your Discord status to your Telegram bio


# Installing
## General Install
### 1. Install Python and the required dependencies
Download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Latest version is recommended, but anything higher than Python 3.7 should work)

Make sure to choose "Add Python to PATH" when installing to make this tutorial easy to follow!

Now, open your command prompt and use those commands to install the required modules:
```commandline
pip install telethon
```

```commandline
pip install discord.py
```

```commandline
pip install pytz
```

### 2. Create the required Applications
To work, livebio-tg requires a Discord bot to recieve data about your current activity and a Telegram app to change your bio.
### 2.1 Create a Discord bot

To create a Discord bot, go to this [page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (You may need to login with your Discord account)

When you are on the page, click on the "New Application" button on the right corner of your screen (Name it anything you want)

After creating an application, go to the "Bot" section on the left side of your screen.

Then, click on "Add Bot" on the right side of your screen. (It may ask you for your 2FA code)

If you get an error saying "Too many users have this name", you should go to the "Application" tab on the left side of your screen and change the name to something more unique.

Now, when the bot is created, copy the token and write it down somewhere (It is used to access the bot so you shouldn't share it with anyone)

After that, scroll down a bit until you find "Privileged Gateway Intents"

In there, enable "Presence Intent" and "Server Members Intent" (You may also want to uncheck the "Public Bot" option)
### 2.2 Create a Telegram Application

To create a Telegram application, go to this [page](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and log into your Telegram account.

After you login, you will need to fill out a form, you can fill it in with anything you want, but make sure that all fields are filled.

If there is no error while creating an app, you will see a screen with your app info.

You need to copy the "api_id" and the "api_hash" and write them down somewhere (Again, you shouldn't share those values with anyone)
